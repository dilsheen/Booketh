# Booketh
This is a prototype for crowdfunding platform for aspiring writers to help them gain funds. At the same time, using Blockchain ensures transaction safety and refunds.

We helped the writers who are waiting for funding opportunities by providing a secure crowdfunding platform using blockchain and at the same time rewarding readers with token. The app we created provides a great exposure to the budding writers waiting on investment opportunities. Booketh gives readers a chance to explore the writer and his book. The whole crowdfunding process is decentralized using blockchain technology to secure fund transfer.
